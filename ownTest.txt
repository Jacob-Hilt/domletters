I think the degree of complication of the   
Legend of Zelda timeline is quite exxagerated.
Many will claim "it's super confusing," but personally,
I don't think it's all too confusing just because of the 
fact that it splits into 3 paths. One path occurs if
Link fails, one path occurs if he defeats Ganon as
an adult, and the final path takes place if Link
warns the Royal Family as a child. I understand that
simply saying "this happens after this" in a linear
fasion is more understandable, but just because a timeline
isn't completely linear, I don't think that makes it 
complicated. Now, the Marvel Cinematic Universe is delving
into multiple timelines with Loki and people are loving it.
Multiple timelines aren't inherently difficult to 'get,'
they're just not what we're used to as people who live
our lives linearly. If the Zelda timeline were as complicated
as Kingdom Hearts, that would be another story... but it's
not. So, I think people need to stop pretending the Zelda
timeline takes more than, like, < 10 minutes MAX to understand.
